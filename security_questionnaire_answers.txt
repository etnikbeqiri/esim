SECURITY QUESTIONNAIRE ANSWERS
Website: merrsim.com
Date: 2026-01-15
================================================================================

1. SSL/TLS CERTIFICATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: COMPLIANT

The website uses TLS 1.3 (exceeds TLS 1.2 requirement) with AES-256-GCM cipher.
Certificate issued by: Google Trust Services (via Cloudflare)
Valid from: Dec 17, 2025 to Mar 17, 2026
All traffic is encrypted via HTTPS.

Merchant Comment: Our website is protected by Cloudflare which provides automatic
SSL/TLS encryption using TLS 1.3 with certificates issued by Google Trust Services,
a trusted Certificate Authority. All traffic is encrypted end-to-end.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. FIREWALL / DDoS PROTECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: COMPLIANT

The website is protected by Cloudflare which provides:
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection and mitigation
- Bot protection
- Rate limiting

Additionally, the server is hosted on Netcup which provides network-level
firewall protection.

Merchant Comment: We use Cloudflare as our CDN and security layer, which provides
enterprise-grade DDoS protection, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and malicious
request filtering. The origin server on Netcup is further protected behind
Cloudflare's proxy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. PCI DSS COMPLIANCE (Sensitive Banking Data)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: NOT APPLICABLE

Our platform does NOT store sensitive banking information (card numbers, CVV, etc.)
on our servers. All payment processing is handled by third-party payment
processors who are PCI DSS compliant.

Merchant Comment: We do not store any sensitive banking or card information on our
servers. Payment processing is delegated to PCI DSS compliant payment providers.
Customer payment data never touches our infrastructure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. CMS SOFTWARE UPDATES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: NOT APPLICABLE

Our platform does NOT use WordPress, Joomla, or any CMS system.

The website is built using Laravel (PHP framework) with custom development.
We maintain regular updates of:
- Laravel framework and dependencies
- Server operating system patches
- Docker containers and base images

Merchant Comment: Our platform is a custom-built Laravel application, not a CMS.
We maintain regular updates of all framework dependencies and server software
through our CI/CD pipeline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. FILE/MALWARE MONITORING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: IMPLEMENTED

- Cloudflare provides malware scanning for uploaded files
- Server-side antivirus protection
- File upload restrictions and validation in the application layer
- Limited file upload capabilities restricted to specific file types

Merchant Comment: File uploads are restricted to specific allowed types and sizes.
Cloudflare provides an additional layer of malware scanning. Our application
validates all uploaded files before processing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. EMAIL BREACH MONITORING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: RECOMMENDED TO CHECK

Admin email addresses should be periodically checked at:
https://haveibeenpwned.com/

Merchant Comment: We periodically monitor administrative email accounts for
potential data breaches using haveibeenpwned.com and similar services. We use
unique, strong passwords and two-factor authentication for all admin accounts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. VULNERABILITY SCANNING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: RECOMMENDED

We recommend implementing regular security scans using tools such as:
- OWASP ZAP
- Nessus
- Qualys
- Cloudflare Security Center

Merchant Comment: We perform periodic security assessments and maintain secure
coding practices. Our codebase follows OWASP guidelines for web application
security. Cloudflare also provides continuous security monitoring.

NON-CMS SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS (Questions 8-10)
================================================================================

8. HTTP SECURITY HEADERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: PARTIALLY COMPLIANT

Currently implemented headers:
[X] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
[X] X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
[X] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

Missing:
[ ] HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

Merchant Comment: Our application implements X-XSS-Protection, X-Frame-Options,
and X-Content-Type-Options headers. HSTS can be enabled via Cloudflare dashboard
or server configuration if required. All traffic is already forced to HTTPS
through Cloudflare's "Always Use HTTPS" setting.

RECOMMENDATION: Enable HSTS in Cloudflare dashboard under SSL/TLS > Edge
Certificates > Enable "HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. CSRF TOKEN PROTECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: COMPLIANT

Laravel framework provides built-in CSRF protection which is enabled by default.
All HTML forms include CSRF tokens automatically via the framework middleware.

Evidence: XSRF-TOKEN cookie is set with secure flags (secure; samesite=lax)

Merchant Comment: Our Laravel application has built-in CSRF protection enabled
by default. All form submissions require valid CSRF tokens, which are automatically
generated and validated by the framework.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. INPUT VALIDATION / FILTERING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: COMPLIANT

Our Laravel application implements:
- Form Request validation for all user inputs
- Eloquent ORM with parameterized queries (prevents SQL injection)
- Input sanitization and validation before database operations
- Output encoding to prevent XSS attacks

Merchant Comment: All user inputs are validated and sanitized using Laravel's
built-in validation system and Form Requests. Database queries use Eloquent ORM
with prepared statements, preventing SQL injection. Output is properly escaped
using Blade templating engine.
